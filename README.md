## Marginal Tax Bracket Breakout

Ever wondered how much of your income goes into each tax bracket? I did! So I created this calculator. Just input your filing status and your adjusted gross income, and see how much tax you pay in each bracket, and what % of your income is sitting in the highest bracket.
